In using this system you will be able to create customers, create items, create an order of a customer with an order then update that order with the basket.
This system has full CRUD functionality in all those key areas and will give you a total cost of your basket.

## Running the tests

Once you have got the system up and running if you wish to test the methods you will find these in the test folder. You can run them with coverage which will break down what methods and lines have been tested.

### Unit Tests
